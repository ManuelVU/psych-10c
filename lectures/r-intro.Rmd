## Review of R 

- In this class we will review some of the basic elements in R.

--

- R is a programming language

--

- One of its main advantages is that users are able to write code and functions
and make them available for other users. 

--

- These functions come in the form of packages which we can download using
RStudio.

# Scripts and R Markdown

---

## R scripts

- R scripts are use to write and store code, for example, if we want to analyze
the data of an experiment, we can write a script that does multiple operations
and stores new data with what we want to show.

--

- We use them to make sure that we can replicate a data analysis, or to 
save the code we used to generate a plot.

---

## R Markdown

- R Markdown files `.rmd` are different from simple R scripts.

--

- It allows us to integrate text and R code in a single file.

--

- Whenever we "knit" this type of file, the integrated R code is executed and the 
variables are saved momentarily.

--

- Notice that the variables are not saved in R as when "running" an R script, 
but they are saved in memory while the file is being created, which means that
we can use them inside the document.

--

- This is really useful when we have graphs or outcomes of a data analysis that 
we want to integrate into a report.

# RSudio

---

## RStudio

- RStudio is a graphical interface for R. It makes it easier to interact with R
by maintaining the console, scripts and graphs all in the same place.

--

- From this point on, we will work simultaneously with RStudio and the lecture 
notes as you should do when working on your assignments.

--

Let's say that we have been assigned a data file to work with on a homework, 
and that we are given a URL to the file such as:
