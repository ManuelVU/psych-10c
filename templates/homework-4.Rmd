**Background:** For this section, we will work with the responses to a memory 
experiment. Researchers are interested in the effects of word frequency (how 
commonly a word is used in English) in two different tasks. A free recall task, 
where participants have to write down all the words they remember after studying
a list. A recognition task, where participants have to tell if they recognize a 
word presented to them as being part of a list that they studied. We have a 
2 by 2 between subjects factorial design. The first factor is the task (free 
recall vs recognition) and the second factor is word frequency (high vs low). 
The researchers recruited 100 participants for the study and assigned 25 to each 
combination of the factor levels (25 each combination) and the dependent 
variable was the number of words that where correctly recognized or correctly 
recalled.
